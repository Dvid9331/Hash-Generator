# Hash-Generator

HashGen is a Python application that generates SHA-256 hashes for files and directories. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to select files or directories and display their hashes. The application also allows users to save the hash report to a file.

## Features

- Generate SHA-256 hashes for individual files.
- Traverse directories and generate SHA-256 hashes for all files within.
- Display the generated hashes in a tree view.
- Save the hash report to a file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HashGen.git
    cd HashGen
    ```
    
## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python HashGen.py
    ```

2. Use the GUI to select a file or directory:
    - Click "Select File" to choose a single file and generate its hash.
    - Click "Select Folder" to choose a directory and generate hashes for all files within.

3. View the generated hashes in the tree view.

4. Optionally, save the hash report automatically by checking the Autosave checkbox, or save it later by clicking "Save as".
